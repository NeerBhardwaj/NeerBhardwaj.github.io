I am a doctoral candidate in mathematics at UIUC. My research interests lie primarily in model theory and its applications. I am part of the <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/research/faculty-research/logic" target="_blank">Logic</a> group, and my advisor is Lou van den Dries. 
        
Before coming over to Illinois, I received my undergraduate education at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Kanpur" target="_blank"> IIT Kanpur</a>.<br>

I was an NSF sponsored intern at the Argonne National Lab for summer 2020. Please look at my LinkedIn page for a more industry oriented profile.
