I am part of the <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/research/faculty-research/logic" target="_blank">Logic</a> group at UIUC, and my advisor is <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/directory/profile/vddries" target="_blank">Lou van den Dries</a>. My research interests lie primarily in model theory and its applications.
        
Before coming over to Illinois in 2015, I received my undergraduate education at the <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in" target="_blank"> Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur</a>.
