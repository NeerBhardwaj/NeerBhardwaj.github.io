I am a mathematics doctoral candidate at UIUC. My research interests lie primarily in model theory and its applications. I am part of the <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/research/faculty-research/logic" target="_blank">Logic</a> group, and my advisor is <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/directory/profile/vddries" target="_blank">Lou van den Dries</a>. 
        
Previously, I received my undergraduate education at <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in" target="_blank"> IIT Kanpur</a>.
